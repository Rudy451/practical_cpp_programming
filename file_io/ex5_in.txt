I see that child who lay upon her bosom
And who bore my name, a man winning his way up
In that path of life which once was mine.
I see him winning it so well, that
My name is made illustrious there by the light of his.

I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away.
I see him, foremost of just judges and honoured men,
Bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know
And golden hair, to this place then fair to look upon,
With not a trace of this day's disfigurement and I hear him
Tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.

It is a far, far better thing that I do,
Than I have ever done;
And it is a far, far better rest that I go
To than I have ever known.
